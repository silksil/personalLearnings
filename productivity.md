# Introduction
Taking the time to reflect and experimeningt with new ways to improve your productivity, can be a great investment. In order to improve my productivity, I have consumed a variety of books, experimented with various methods and spend quit some hours reflecting on what works, and what doesn't. This article aims to digest the most important lessons and practices that I have learned on productivity. As the way I work changes over time, I will update this post everytime this happens.

The articles is divided into two pieces. The first part, principles, can be seen as the guiding principles, or rules, in order to be productive. In the second part, systems, I glue many of these principles together to have an understanding how I apply it in real-life and what I do from moment to moment on a daily basis. In other words, whereas the principles focus more on the macro, higher-level ideas and concepts, the systems focusses more on micro, and daily processes I go through. I beli

# Principles
This section is divided into three seperate sub-sections:
1. **Work effectively:** getting the right things done. 
2. **Work efficiently:**  getting more things done through systems and rituals. 
3. **Work disciplinary:** getting more things done through self-control.

## 1. Work effectively
#### 1.1 Set goals
Goals are important to guide you towards the right direction.
> Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results… Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.  — James Clear

#### 1.2 Focus on what is important
Focus on the goals that are the wisest possible investment of your time and energy. The more you are putting on your plate, the easier you get distracted or overwhelmed, the less you focus on what matters, the less you accomplish.

#### 1.3 Keep the bigger picture in mind 
Keeping the bigger picture in mind prevent you from working on stuff that doesn't matter. Practically, this could mean having year goals, monthly goals, weekly goals and having regular sections where you review these goals. 

# 2. Work efficiently
#### 2.1 Follow a system
Besides having defined the goals, you have to have processes that lead to those desired results. How this system looks differ per person and work context. Examples of different systems in different contexts: 
- Online Marketing: GROWS process. 
- Programming/project management: SCRUM
- Brainstorming: Design thinking
- Product/market fit: Lean Startup Canvas, The Value Proposition Canvas, SPRINT

#### 2.2 Define tasks & plan
Instead of figuring out in the moment what to do, you should figure this out beforehand. This reduces the chance of being tempted to do something else and preserves mental energy for work itself. For me, this means having a weekly planning in which I:
- Define the tasks of a project/goal.
- Plan on which day and time you gonna work on what.

#### 2.3 Don't multitask
The ability to disconnect, as opposed to the standard practice of answering a message, or checking the news every hour, allows you to get more things done that matter and prevent you from getting a chaotic brain: 
> People who multitask all the time can’t filter out irrelevancy. They can’t manage a working memory. They’re chronically distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand…they’re pretty much mental wrecks. — Clifford Nas

#### 2.4 Remove distractions
As suggested in the section above, multi-tasking fucks up your brain. This includes sneaking in answering a text or emails:
> [...] it’s hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate. To put this more concretely: If every moment of potential boredom in your life—say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research. — Cal Newport

To reduce the chances of being distracted you can 1.) remove social media and other distracting apps, 2.) turn off notifications, 3.) use apps like Freedom to block content and 4.) use a headphone to block out sounds. 

#### 2.5 Use your unconscious to solve problems
Decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind is required (e.g. doing math). Decisions that involve large amounts of information and vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind might be better in solving it. 

#### 2.6 Doodle & visualize
Companies like Facebook and Google use doodling to work more productively and creatively. [Science suggest](https://www.fastcompany.com/3024420/how-to-turn-your-mindless-doodles-into-productivity-enhancers) people who doodle recall more information, have a deeper understanding of a concept and are better able to communicate it to others. 

#### 2.7 Rest
Resting serves three purposes:
- Provides you with an opportunity to recharge your energy.
- You can use this time to use the Internet and then avoid it outside these times. 
- To let your unconscious work on a decision. 

#### 2.8 Automate
Schedule time where you define and tackle (i.e. automate and systemize) inefficiencies. Examples:
* Make it easy to find information across platforms (Drive, Evernote, Desktop, Email etc.)
* Password manager (Dashlane)
* Automatically start all necessary programs when restarting the computer.

# 3. Work disciplinary
Self-control is one of the most vital virtues for getting what you aim for; it's a better predictor of academic success than intelligence and a stronger determinant of effective leadership than charisma. Luckily, self-control works like a muscle. It gets tired from use, but regular exercise makes it stronger. Below are some principles that guide you using your self-control, and being disciplinary. 

#### 3.1 Separate real awards from false awards
If we recognize a reward -- i.e. a possibility to feel good, such as the sight of tasty food, the smell of coffee, noticing a notification -- dopamine is released. When dopamine hijacks your attention, the mind becomes fixated on obtaining or repeating whatever triggered it. It causes us to feel alert, awake and aroused, which can help you in achieving your goal. Nonetheless, it can make us feel restless and distracted too by steering us into immediate gratification. Thus, separate the real rewards that give our lives meaning from the false rewards that only provide you with immediate gratification. 
    
#### 3.2 Have self-compassion
When we fail to pursue the activities that we aim to pursue, there is a tendency to criticize yourself, which works counterproductive on our self-control:
> Study after study shows that self-criticism is consistently associated with less motivation and worse self-control. It is also one of the single biggest predictors of depression, which drains both “I will” power and “I want” power. In contrast, self-compassion—being supportive and kind to yourself, especially in the face of stress and failure—is associated with more motivation and better self-control. — Kelly McGonigal
    
#### 3.3 Be aware of the tricks that your mind tends to plays
- **Moral licensing:** If you do something good, you feel good about yourself. This increases your trust your impulses—which can increase the tendency to give yourself permission to do something bad.
- **Goal dreaming:** A mind can get so excited about the opportunity to act on a goal, it mistakes that opportunity with the satisfaction of actually accomplished the goal, causing us to neglect actually working on the actual goal. 
- **Unrealistic optimism** The decision to change is the ultimate in instant gratification—you get all the good feelings before anything’s been done. But if you fail to meet expectations triggers the same old guilt, depression, and self-doubt, causing people to abandon their efforts altogether. Only after we feel out of control and in need of another hit of hope, we will once again vow to change.

# System
This section is divided into two seperate sub-sections:
1. **Work tools:** the tools that I use to get things done. 
2. **Work schedule:**  getting more things done through systems and rituals. 

## Tools
The main tools that use to support my work:
#### Planning
- **Google sheets(yearly & monthly):** To define yearly and monthly goals. 
- **Task manager/Asana(weekly & daily):** To create projects in relation to the monthly goals and define the tasks. Additionaly, I use it to define the tasks I want to complete weekly and daily. 
- **Calendar(weekly, daily and hourly):** Is used to include appointments. In some cases it also used to define during what time periods I am working on what tasks. 
- **Notebook(daily)**: I write also write down the tasks that I assigned to myself in Asana for that day. I prefer having a physical checklist in sight, instead of shifting to Asana everytime I finish a task.  

#### Other
- **Notebook*: make notes, doodle and visualize. 
- **Evernote: make and organize notes** 

## Average (work) day
| Time  |      Activity      |
|----------|:-------------:|
| 09:00am-09:05pm| Review to-list and planning|

| 3:15pm-4:45pm|    Work   |
| 4:45pm-5:00pm|    Clean + Review + Plan   |

## Review & Plan
On a daily, weekly and monthly I schedule and priotize time to reflect on the past, and meditate on what I aim to do in the future.
#### Daily
At the end of every day time is scheduled to review the day and plan the next day. This includes:
- **Review**: Update in the task manager the tasks that have been finished.
- **Cleaning-up**: Close programs tabs, save in the right folder and clean-up email. 
- **Plan**: Move tasks in Asana for the next day and write them also down in a notebook. 

#### Weekly
- **Review**: 1.) Review whether tasks are left in Asana that were planned for this week. 2.) Update whether goals are met in Google Spreadsheet. 3.) Review and tackle any constrains that impacted my productivity. 
- **Plan**: Review the monthly goals in Google Spreadsheet and create or assign tasks in Asana for the next week. 

#### Monthly
- **Review**: 1.) Review whether the goals were met in Google Spreadsheet.
- **Plan**: Review the yearly goals in Google Spreadsheet and define the goals for next month.  y. They’re chronically distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand…they’re pretty much mental wrecks. — Clifford Nas
