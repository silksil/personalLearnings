### Automate and Eleminate Roadblacks
When producing it happens you encounter tasks that consume time, whereas this is not needed, or at least the time spend on these tasks can be reduced. In order to tackle this, it's an good investment to spend time defining and tackling these inefficencies. Examples of inefficiencies that can be tackled:
* Making it easy to find information across different platforms (drive, evernote, email etc.)
* Have a password manager (dash lane)
* A tool that automatically fils in forms with contact info (dashlane)
* Automatically start all programs that are essential for being productive when starting the coputer. 

To make sure I do not forget efficiencies that notice while working, by having backlog where I can note them. In order to assure I priortize this for this activity, I have scheduled one time slot a week to work in this.
