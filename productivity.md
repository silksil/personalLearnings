## Mental strategies
### Snow-ball effect: 
> A tree as big around as you can reach starts with a small seed; a thousand-mile journey starts with one step. — Lao-tse

When you have in mind to work on something, thoughts and internal obstacles can prevent you from actually making things happen. The longer you wait and the more you unconsciously think, the bigger the obstacle to actually start and make things happen. Thus, often the best way to make things happen is to **just start rolling**, and remember that there is no beginning and end, but only a **continuous cycle**. In the words of Benjamin Hoff: 

> Wisdom, Happiness, and Courage are not waiting somewhere out beyond sight at the end of a straight line; they’re part of a continuous cycle that begins right here. They’re not only the ending, but the beginning as well. The more it snows, the more it goes, the more it goes on snowing.

### Differentiate between "I want to" and "I have to"
As argued in the section above, internal obstacles can prevent you from actually making things happen. One way these internal obstacles can occur is by having the idea that tasks are an obligation, or having the feeling it is imposed on you. In other words, that you have the feeling that you have to do it, without having the feeling that you want to do it. Now, of course, it can happen that you have to do tasks that you do not enjoy doing. Nonetheless, these tasks become so much easier if you consciously decide that you want to do it anyway. In order to rationalize these decisions, I often say to myself that it's simply part of life, or that the tasks at least teach me to be disciplined. For example, I do not enjoy cooking that much, but **I want to eat healthy**, so **I want** to prioritize time buying groceries and cooking. 

## Principles
### Be clear on how you work
Being clear on how you work to 1.)**reduce the amount of tempetation** to shifts into reward-seeking mode and to 2.) **preserve mental energy** for work itsels instead of figuring what you need to do in the moment. As suggested by Cal Newport, this includes: 
* Where you’ll will work and for how long.
* How you’ll work once you start to work. 
* How you’ll support your work (tools, checklists, food, notebooks)

### Focus on what is important
The more you are trying to do, the more easy you get distracted or are overwhelmed, the less you accomplish. Thus, focus on the goals that benefit you most, and focus on the the most important tasks that support a goal.

### Be accountable and measure
Act on Lead Measures […] Lag measures describe the think you’re ultimately trying to improve. […] Lead measus, on the other hand, “measures the new behaviour that will drive success on the lag measures.” 

### Remove distractions
Being distracted fucks up your brain:
> Once your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, Nass discovered, it’s hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate. To put this more concretely: If every moment of potential boredom in your life—say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research, it’s not ready for deep work—even if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration. — Cal Newport

Actions that I have taken to reduce distractions:
- Remove social media from your phone and other distracting apps.
- Turn off all notifications. 
- Use a app like Freedom to block apps and websites, on both phone and desktop.
- Use an headphone or earplugs to block out sound. 

### Embrace downtime and boredom
Downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply
The authors of this study, led by the Dutch psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis, set out to prove that some decisions are better left to your unconscious mind to untangle. 
* Don’t take breaks from distraction. Instead take breaks from focus. 
* Schedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times.

### Structure your thoughts and ideas
careful review of the relevant variables for solving the problem

For example, the main points you want to make in the chapter. Define the specific next-step question you need to answer using these variables. Example “How am I going to effectively open this chapter?,” you now have a specific target for your attention. The final step is to consolidate your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you identified.

### Elimenate roadblocks
When working it happens you encounter tasks that consume time, whereas this is unnecessary,  or at least the time spend on these tasks can be reduced. In order to tackle this, it's a wise investment to prioritize time defining and tackling these inefficiencies. Examples of inefficiencies that can be tackled:
* Making it easy to find information across different platforms (Drive, Evernote, Desktop, Email etc.)
* Have a password manager (Dashlane)
* A tool that automatically fils in forms with contact info (Dashlane)
* Automatically start all programs that are essential for being productive when starting the computer. 

In order to assure you don't forget inefficiencies that come-up and you notice while working, you can create a file where you can note the inefficiency. Periodically(in my case weekly)I have scheduled a time slot that focuses on actually tackling these issues.
