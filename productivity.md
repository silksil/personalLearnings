## Introduction
The differences between principles and practicalities, is that principles stay the same, whereas practicalities can change over time. For example, the principle 'Be clear on how you work' stays the same, but over time I might iterate on how this principles applies in the real-life aka in practice. 

### Why
#### To achieve your goals
When pit against other virtues, willpower comes out on top. Self-control is a better predictor of academic success than intelligence (take that, SATs), a stronger determinant of effective leadership than charisma (sorry, Tony Robbins), and more important for marital bliss than empathy (yes, the secret to lasting marriage may be learning how to keep your mouth shut).

# Work effectively
### 1. Focus on what is important
Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done. It doesn’t mean just doing less for the sake of less either. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential

The more you are trying to do, the more easy you get distracted or are overwhelmed, the less you accomplish. Thus, focus on the goals that benefit you most, and focus on the the most important tasks that support a goal.

### 2. Use methodologies to make the right decisions
careful review of the relevant variables for solving the problem

For example, the main points you want to make in the chapter. Define the specific next-step question you need to answer using these variables. Example “How am I going to effectively open this chapter?,” you now have a specific target for your attention. The final step is to consolidate your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you identified.

### 3. Be accountable and measure
Act on Lead Measures […] Lag measures describe the think you’re ultimately trying to improve. […] Lead measus, on the other hand, “measures the new behaviour that will drive success on the lag measures.” 


# Work efficiently
### 1. Be clear on how you work (part 2)
Being clear on how you work to 1.) **reduce the amount of tempetation** to shifts into reward-seeking mode and to 2.) **preserve mental energy** for work itsels instead of figuring what you need to do in the moment. As suggested by Cal Newport, this includes: 
* Where you’ll will work and for how long.
* How you’ll work once you start to work. 
* How you’ll support your work (tools, checklists, food, notebooks)

### 2. Focus on 1 task at a time
The more you are trying to do, the more easy you get distracted or are overwhelmed, the less you accomplish. Thus, focus on the goals that benefit you most, and focus on the the most important tasks that support a goal.

### 3. Remove distractions and stay organized
Being distracted fucks up your brain:
> Once your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, Nass discovered, it’s hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate. To put this more concretely: If every moment of potential boredom in your life—say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research, it’s not ready for deep work—even if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration. — Cal Newport

Actions that I have taken to reduce distractions:
- Remove social media from your phone and other distracting apps.
- Turn off all notifications. 
- Use a app like Freedom to block apps and websites, on both phone and desktop.
- Use an headphone or earplugs to block out sound. 

### 4.Rest
Downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply
The authors of this study, led by the Dutch psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis, set out to prove that some decisions are better left to your unconscious mind to untangle. 
* Don’t take breaks from distraction. Instead take breaks from focus. 
* Schedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times.

### 5. Elimenate roadblocks
When working it happens you encounter tasks that consume time, whereas this is unnecessary,  or at least the time spend on these tasks can be reduced. In order to tackle this, it's a wise investment to prioritize time defining and tackling these inefficiencies. Examples of inefficiencies that can be tackled:
* Making it easy to find information across different platforms (Drive, Evernote, Desktop, Email etc.)
* Have a password manager (Dashlane)
* A tool that automatically fils in forms with contact info (Dashlane)
* Automatically start all programs that are essential for being productive when starting the computer. 

In order to assure you don't forget inefficiencies that come-up and you notice while working, you can create a file where you can note the inefficiency. Periodically(in my case weekly)I have scheduled a time slot that focuses on actually tackling these issues. 


# Work contiounsly 
Working contiounsly refers to maximizing the time spend on your desired activity. This is largely influend by the degree of **self-control**. As argued in the book Willpower Instict, self-control is probably the most vital virtue for getting what you aim for; it's a better predictor of academic success than intelligence and a stronger determinant of effective leadership than charisma. 

Self-control is a matter of understanding these different parts of ourselves, not fundamentally changing who we are. In the quest for self-control, the usual weapons we wield against ourselves—guilt, stress, and shame—don’t work. People who have the greatest self-control aren’t waging self-war. They have learned to accept and integrate these competing selves.

### Sepereate the real awards from the false awards
* Separate the real awards from the false awards
    * How does the reward system compel us to act? When the brain recognizes an opportunity for reward, it releases a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Dopamine tells the rest of the brain what to pay attention to and what to get our greedy little hands on. A dopamine rush doesn’t create happiness itself—the feeling is more like arousal. We feel alert, awake, and captivated. We recognize the possibility of feeling good and are willing to work for that feeling. Desire doesn’t always make us feel good—sometimes it makes us feel downright rotten. That’s because dopamine’s primary function is to make us pursue happiness, not to make us happy. If we are to have any self-control, we need to separate the real rewards that give our lives meaning from the false rewards that keep us distracted and addicted.
    
### Have self-compassion
* After you fail, don’t critique yourself but have self-compassion:
    * Study after study shows that self-criticism is consistently associated with less motivation and worse self-control. It is also one of the single biggest predictors of depression, which drains both “I will” power and “I want” power. In contrast, self-compassion—being supportive and kind to yourself, especially in the face of stress and failure—is associated with more motivation and better self-control.
    
    
### Be honest to thyself
moral licensing: When it comes to right and wrong, most of us are not striving for moral perfection. We just want to feel good enough—which then gives us permission to do whatever we want.

Sometimes the mind gets so excited about the opportunity to act on a goal, it mistakes that opportunity with the satisfaction of having actually accomplished the goal. And with the goal to make a healthy choice out of the way, the unmet goal—immediate pleasure—takes priority.

Unrealistic optimism may make us feel good in the moment, but it sets us up to feel much worse later on. The decision to change is the ultimate in instant gratification—you get all the good feelings before anything’s been done. But the challenge of actually making a change can be a rude awakening, and the initial rewards are rarely as transformative as our most hopeful fantasies (“I lost five pounds, and I still have a crappy job!”)


### Snow-ball effect: 
> A tree as big around as you can reach starts with a small seed; a thousand-mile journey starts with one step. — Lao-tse

When you have in mind to work on something, thoughts and internal obstacles can prevent you from actually making things happen. The longer you wait and the more you unconsciously think, the bigger the obstacle to actually start and make things happen. Thus, often the best way to make things happen is to **just start rolling**, and remember that there is no beginning and end, but only a **continuous cycle**. In the words of Benjamin Hoff: 

> Wisdom, Happiness, and Courage are not waiting somewhere out beyond sight at the end of a straight line; they’re part of a continuous cycle that begins right here. They’re not only the ending, but the beginning as well. The more it snows, the more it goes, the more it goes on snowing.



## Commit
Self-control is like a muscle. It gets tired from use, but regular exercise makes it stronger. Our challenge is to train like an intelligent athlete, pushing our limits but also pacing ourselves.
### Differentiate between "I want to" and "I have to"
As argued in the section above, internal obstacles can prevent you from actually making things happen. One way these internal obstacles can occur is by having the idea that tasks are an obligation, or having the feeling it is imposed on you. In other words, that you have the feeling that you have to do it, without having the feeling that you want to do it. Now, of course, it can happen that you have to do tasks that you do not enjoy doing. Nonetheless, these tasks become so much easier if you consciously decide that you want to do it anyway. In order to rationalize these decisions, I often say to myself that it's simply part of life, or that the tasks at least teach me to be disciplined. For example, I do not enjoy cooking that much, but **I want to eat healthy**, so **I want** to prioritize time buying groceries and cooking. 

### Don't wait for inspiration
Inspiration is for amateurs,” Close says. “The rest of us just show up and get to work.”  

### Commit
“Auden believed that a life of such military precision was essential to his creativity, a way of taming the muse to his own schedule. “A modern stoic,” he observed, “knows that the surest way to discipline passion is to discipline time: decide what you want or ought to do during the day, then always do it at exactly the same moment every day, and passion will give you no trouble.” 

“to sustain these true moments of insight one has to be highly disciplined, lead a disciplined life,” 

The only person you can control is you. So focus on making yourself who you want to be:
