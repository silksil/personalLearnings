# Introduction
This article is divided in three sections to describe how to be and remain productive.
1. **Work effectively:** getting the right things done. 
2. **Work efficently:**  getting more things done through systems and rituals. 
3. **Work continously:** getting more things done through self-control.

This article is written with the help of books (i.e. The Willpower Instict, Focus, Deep Work), blog posts (Ray, ) and personal experience. 

## Why striving for being productive?
1. To achieve your goals
2. To keep up with our promises.
3. Because a focused life is a meaningfull life.

# Work effectively
1. **Focus on what is important**: Focus on the goals that are the wisest possible investment of your time and energy. The more you are putting on your plate, the more easy you get distracted or are overwhelmed, the less you focus on what matters, and the less you accomplish.

2. **Keep the bigger picture in mind**: Keeping the bigger picture in mind prevent you from working on stuff that doesn't matter.

3. **Follow a methodology** Systems and methodologies can help you to contiounsly guide you. How this methodology looks in practice depends highly on the context you are working in, for example:
- Online Marketing: GROWS process. 
- Programming / project management: SCRUM
- Brainstorming: Design thinking
- Product/market fit: Lean Startup Canvus, The Value Proposition Canvas

# Work efficiently
### 1. Plan
Instead of figuring out in the moment what to do, you should defined ahead the goals and the tasks of a particular day. This reduces the chance of being tempted to do something else, and preserves mental energy for work itself.

### 2. 1 task at a time
Multi-tasking doesn't work:
> People who multitask all the time can’t filter out irrelevancy. They can’t manage a working memory. They’re chronically distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand…they’re pretty much mental wrecks.

### 3. Disconnect
This ability to fully disconnect, as opposed to the standard practice of sneaking in a few quick work e-mails, or checking news every hour, allows to get more things done that matter. 

### 4. Remove disctractions
Being distracted fucks up your brain:
> Once your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, Nass discovered, it’s hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate. — Cal Newport

To remove descrations you can 1.) remove social media and other distracting apps, 2.) turn off notifications, 3.) use apps like Freedom to block content and 4.) use an headphone to block out sound. 

### 4. Rest
Resting servers three purposes:
- Provides you with an opportunity recharge your energy.
- You can us this time to use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times. 
- 

### 5. Automate and systemize
Schedule time where you define and tackle inefficiencies: 
* Make it easy to find information across platforms (Drive, Evernote, Desktop, Email etc.)
* Password manager (Dashlane)
* Automatically start all necessary programs when restarting the computer.

# Work contiounsly 
In book Willpower Instict, it is argued that the self-control is the most vital virtue for getting what you aim for; it's a better predictor of academic success than intelligence and a stronger determinant of effective leadership than charisma. 

Self-control is a matter of understanding these different parts of ourselves, not fundamentally changing who we are. In the quest for self-control, the usual weapons we wield against ourselves—guilt, stress, and shame—don’t work. People who have the greatest self-control aren’t waging self-war. They have learned to accept and integrate these competing selves.

### Sepereate the real awards from the false awards
* Separate the real awards from the false awards
    * How does the reward system compel us to act? When the brain recognizes an opportunity for reward, it releases a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Dopamine tells the rest of the brain what to pay attention to and what to get our greedy little hands on. A dopamine rush doesn’t create happiness itself—the feeling is more like arousal. We feel alert, awake, and captivated. We recognize the possibility of feeling good and are willing to work for that feeling. Desire doesn’t always make us feel good—sometimes it makes us feel downright rotten. That’s because dopamine’s primary function is to make us pursue happiness, not to make us happy. If we are to have any self-control, we need to separate the real rewards that give our lives meaning from the false rewards that keep us distracted and addicted.
    
### Have self-compassion
* After you fail, don’t critique yourself but have self-compassion:
    * Study after study shows that self-criticism is consistently associated with less motivation and worse self-control. It is also one of the single biggest predictors of depression, which drains both “I will” power and “I want” power. In contrast, self-compassion—being supportive and kind to yourself, especially in the face of stress and failure—is associated with more motivation and better self-control.
    
    
### Be honest to thyself
moral licensing: When it comes to right and wrong, most of us are not striving for moral perfection. We just want to feel good enough—which then gives us permission to do whatever we want.

Sometimes the mind gets so excited about the opportunity to act on a goal, it mistakes that opportunity with the satisfaction of having actually accomplished the goal. And with the goal to make a healthy choice out of the way, the unmet goal—immediate pleasure—takes priority.

Unrealistic optimism may make us feel good in the moment, but it sets us up to feel much worse later on. The decision to change is the ultimate in instant gratification—you get all the good feelings before anything’s been done. But the challenge of actually making a change can be a rude awakening, and the initial rewards are rarely as transformative as our most hopeful fantasies (“I lost five pounds, and I still have a crappy job!”)


### Snow-ball effect: 
> A tree as big around as you can reach starts with a small seed; a thousand-mile journey starts with one step. — Lao-tse

When you have in mind to work on something, thoughts and internal obstacles can prevent you from actually making things happen. The longer you wait and the more you unconsciously think, the bigger the obstacle to actually start and make things happen. Thus, often the best way to make things happen is to **just start rolling**, and remember that there is no beginning and end, but only a **continuous cycle**. In the words of Benjamin Hoff: 

> Wisdom, Happiness, and Courage are not waiting somewhere out beyond sight at the end of a straight line; they’re part of a continuous cycle that begins right here. They’re not only the ending, but the beginning as well. The more it snows, the more it goes, the more it goes on snowing.



## Commit
Self-control is like a muscle. It gets tired from use, but regular exercise makes it stronger. Our challenge is to train like an intelligent athlete, pushing our limits but also pacing ourselves.
### Differentiate between "I want to" and "I have to"
As argued in the section above, internal obstacles can prevent you from actually making things happen. One way these internal obstacles can occur is by having the idea that tasks are an obligation, or having the feeling it is imposed on you. In other words, that you have the feeling that you have to do it, without having the feeling that you want to do it. Now, of course, it can happen that you have to do tasks that you do not enjoy doing. Nonetheless, these tasks become so much easier if you consciously decide that you want to do it anyway. In order to rationalize these decisions, I often say to myself that it's simply part of life, or that the tasks at least teach me to be disciplined. For example, I do not enjoy cooking that much, but **I want to eat healthy**, so **I want** to prioritize time buying groceries and cooking. 

### Don't wait for inspiration
Inspiration is for amateurs,” Close says. “The rest of us just show up and get to work.”  

### Commit
“Auden believed that a life of such military precision was essential to his creativity, a way of taming the muse to his own schedule. “A modern stoic,” he observed, “knows that the surest way to discipline passion is to discipline time: decide what you want or ought to do during the day, then always do it at exactly the same moment every day, and passion will give you no trouble.” 

“to sustain these true moments of insight one has to be highly disciplined, lead a disciplined life,” 

The only person you can control is you. So focus on making yourself who you want to be:


### 1. Be clear on how you work (part 2)
Being clear on how you work to 1.) **reduce the amount of tempetation** to shifts into reward-seeking mode and to 2.) **preserve mental energy** for work itself. As suggested by Cal Newport, this includes: 
* Where you’ll will work and for how long.
* How you’ll work once you start to work. 
* How you’ll support your work (tools, checklists, food, notebooks)
