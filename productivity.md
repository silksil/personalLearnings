## Mindset 

### Snow-ball effect: 
> A tree as big around as you can reach starts with a small seed; a thousand-mile journey starts with one step. — Lao-tse

When you have in mind to work on something, thoughts and internal obstacles can prevent you from actually making things happen. The longer you wait and the more you unconsciously think, the bigger the obstacle to actually start and make things happen. Thus, often the best way to make things happen is to **just start rolling**, and remember that there is no beginning and end, but only a **continuous cycle**. In the words of Benjamin Hoff: 

> Wisdom, Happiness, and Courage are not waiting somewhere out beyond sight at the end of a straight line; they’re part of a continuous cycle that begins right here. They’re not only the ending, but the beginning as well. The more it snows, the more it goes, the more it goes on snowing.

### Differentiate between "I want to" and "I have to"
As argued in the section above, internal obstacles can prevent you from actually making things happen. One way these internal obstacles can occur is by having the idea that tasks are an obligation, or having the feeling it is imposed on you. In other words, that you have the feeling that you have to do it, without having the feeling that you want to do it. Now, of course, it can happen that you have to do tasks that you do not enjoy doing. Nonetheless, these tasks become so much easier if you consciously decide that you want to do it anyway. In order to rationalize these decisions, I often say to myself that it's simply part of life, or that the tasks at least teach me to be disciplined. For example, I do not enjoy cooking that much, but **I want to eat healthy**, so **I want** to prioritize time buying groceries and cooking. 

## Habits
### Define how you work
### Focus on what is important
### Be accountable 
### Measure
### Remove distractions
### Embrace downtime and boredom
### Structure your deep thinking

### Elimenate roadblocks
When working it happens you encounter tasks that consume time, whereas this is unnecessary,  or at least the time spend on these tasks can be reduced. In order to tackle this, it's a wise investment to prioritize time defining and tackling these inefficiencies. Examples of inefficiencies that can be tackled:
* Making it easy to find information across different platforms (Drive, Evernote, Desktop, Email etc.)
* Have a password manager (Dashlane)
* A tool that automatically fils in forms with contact info (Dashlane)
* Automatically start all programs that are essential for being productive when starting the computer. 

In order to assure you don't forget inefficiencies that come-up and you notice while working, you can create a file where you can note the inefficiency. Periodically(in my case weekly)I have scheduled a time slot that focuses on actually tackling these issues.
