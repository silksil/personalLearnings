# Introduction
This article is divided in three sections to describe how to be and remain productive.
1. **Work effectively:** getting the right things done. 
2. **Work efficently:**  getting more things done through systems and rituals. 
3. **Work continously:** getting more things done through self-control.

This article is written with the help of books (i.e. The Willpower Instict, Focus, Deep Work, The Doodle Revolution) and through personal experience. 

# 1. Work effectively
#### 1.1 Focus on what is important
Focus on the goals that are the wisest possible investment of your time and energy. The more you are putting on your plate, the more easy you get distracted or are overwhelmed, the less you focus on what matters, and the less you accomplish.

#### 1.2 Keep the bigger picture in mind 
Keeping the bigger picture in mind prevent you from working on stuff that doesn't matter.

#### 1.3 Follow a methodology
Systems and methodologies can help you to contiounsly guide you. How this methodology looks in practice depends highly on the context you are working in, for example:
- Online Marketing: GROWS process. 
- Programming / project management: SCRUM
- Brainstorming: Design thinking
- Product/market fit: Lean Startup Canvus, The Value Proposition Canvas

# 2. Work efficiently
#### 2.1 Define tasks & Plan
Instead of figuring out in the moment what to do, you should figure this out beforehand. This reduces the chance of being tempted to do something else, and preserves mental energy for work itself. For me, this means having a weekly planning in which I:
- Define the tasks of a project / goal.
- Plan on which day and time you gonna work on what.

#### 2.2 Don't multitask
The ability to disconnect, as opposed to the standard practice of answering a message, or checking news every hour, allows you to get more things done that matter and prevent you from getting a chaotic brain: 
> People who multitask all the time can’t filter out irrelevancy. They can’t manage a working memory. They’re chronically distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand…they’re pretty much mental wrecks. — Clifford Nas

#### 2.3 Remove disctractions
As suggested in the section above, multi-tasking fucks up your brain. This includes sneaking in answering a text or emails:
> [...] it’s hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate. To put this more concretely: If every moment of potential boredom in your life—say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research. — Cal Newport

To reduce the chances of being distracted you can 1.) remove social media and other distracting apps, 2.) turn off notifications, 3.) use apps like Freedom to block content and 4.) use an headphone to block out sound. 

#### 2.4 Use your unconscious to solve problems
Decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved (e.g. doing math). For decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue.

#### 2.5 Doodle & visualize
Companies like Facebook and Google use doodling to work more productively and creatively. [Science suggest](https://www.fastcompany.com/3024420/how-to-turn-your-mindless-doodles-into-productivity-enhancers)people who doodle recall more information and have a deeper understanding of a concept and are better able to communicate it to others. 

#### 2.6 Rest
Resting serves three purposes:
- Provides you with an opportunity recharge your energy.
- You can us this time to use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times. 
- To let your unconscious work on a decisions. 

#### 2.7 Automate and systemize
Schedule time where you define and tackle (i.e. automate and systemize) inefficiencies. Examples:
* Make it easy to find information across platforms (Drive, Evernote, Desktop, Email etc.)
* Password manager (Dashlane)
* Automatically start all necessary programs when restarting the computer.

# 3. Work disciplinary
Self-control is one of the most vital virtue for getting what you aim for; it's a better predictor of academic success than intelligence and a stronger determinant of effective leadership than charisma. Luckily, self-control works like a muscle. It gets tired from use, but regular exercise makes it stronger. Below are some principles that guide you in being disciplinary. 

#### 3.1 Sepereate real awards from false awards
If we recognize a reward -- i.e. a possibility to feel good, such as -- sight of tasty food, the smell of coffee, discount, a smile from a sexy stranger etc. -- dopamine is released. When dopamine hijacks your attention, the mind becomes fixated on obtaining or repeating whatever triggered it. It causes us to feel alert, awake and aroused, which can help you in achieving your goal. Nonetheless, it can make us feel restless and distracted too by steering us into immediate gratification. Thus, separate the real rewards that give our lives meaning from the false rewards that keep us distracted and addicted.
    
#### 3.2 Have self-compassion
When we fail to pursue the activities that we aime to pursue, there is a tendency to crisize ourself, which works counterproductive on our self-control:
> Study after study shows that self-criticism is consistently associated with less motivation and worse self-control. It is also one of the single biggest predictors of depression, which drains both “I will” power and “I want” power. In contrast, self-compassion—being supportive and kind to yourself, especially in the face of stress and failure—is associated with more motivation and better self-control.
    
#### 3.3 Beaware of the tricks that your mind plays
- **Moral licensing:** When you do something good, you feel good about yourself. This means you’re more likely to trust your impulses—which often means giving yourself permission to do something bad.
- **Goal dreaming:** Sometimes the mind gets so excited about the opportunity to act on a goal, it mistakes that opportunity with the satisfaction of having actually accomplished the goal. And with the goal to make a healthy choice out of the way, the unmet goal—immediate pleasure—takes priority.
- **Unrealistic optimism** The decision to change is the ultimate in instant gratification—you get all the good feelings before anything’s been done. But the challenge of actually making a change can be a rude awakening, and the initial rewards are rarely as transformative as our most hopeful fantasies (“I lost five pounds, and I still have a crappy job!”)
