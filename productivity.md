# Introduction
Investing time to improve your productivity, can provide you over time with great returns. Not surprsingly, yearly millions of productivity books are being sold, and the the internet is overloaded with so many articles on the topic you wouldn't able to consume it over a life-time even if you would make it a full-time job. 

I don’t got a phd on productivity, but I have read information written by people who know a lot about productibity. This article aims to bring all that knowledge together by outlining my key-learnings on the topic. 

This article is divided into two parts. The first part — which I have named 'Principles' — describes the guiding principles, or rules, I follow to be productive. These principles are very much universal and applicable to most individuals, and if you would pick up any productivity book it’s likely being discussed in their. The second part, 'Systems', glues many of these principles together and describes how I apply the principles in the real world and what I do daily moment to moment. So, whereas principles focus more on the macro, universal, higher-level thoughts and ideas, the system focusses more on the micro, personal and the moment by moment processes I go trough.

As with most information that is out there, 90% is copied from somebody else, and 10% is my own. Throughout the article I will refer to the sources I have copied information from, and at the end you will find a list of all reference resources. Lastly, I believe it is good to know that some of the most productive people continuously make changes in the way they work. So, it’s likely that I also will make changes overtime, but I will make sure I will update article everytime that happens. Now, let’s get productive. 

# Principles
As said before, this part describes principles, or rules, that you will guide in being productive. To better understand what I think it takes to be productive, I have separated these principles into three sub-sections:
1. **Work effectively:** getting the right things done. 
2. **Work efficiently:**  getting more things done. 
3. **Work disciplinary:** getting more things done through self-control.

## 1. Work effectively
#### 1.1 Set goals
It's hard to navigate without having something to aim at; you need goals to guide yourself towards the right direction. Goals refer to the results you want to achieve, not how you want to achieve it (see 2.1. 'Follow a system')

#### 1.2 Priotize
You got limited time and resources, and different desires can lead to conflicting goals. So focus on the goals that are the wisest possible investment of your time and energy. 

# 2. Work efficiently
#### 2.1 Follow a system
Besides having defined the goals, you have to have processes that lead to those desired results. 
> Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. — James Clear

In the second part of this article I will go more into the depth into the processes that I follow. Additionaly, these are some methodologies that that you can follow in relation to the kind of work or phase you are in:
- Online Marketing: GROWS process. 
- Programming/project management: SCRUM
- Brainstorming: Design thinking
- Product/market fit: Lean Startup Canvas, The Value Proposition Canvas, SPRINT

#### 2.2 Break goals into manageable pieces
After having devined (big) goals, you need to break them down into manageble pieces. Pieces you can relate to the life goals, and where you know daily from moment to moment what to do in order to achieve those goals. Instead of figuring what to do in the moment what to do, you can have fixed tiuemslots in which review and define tasks in relation to a goal, so you can preserve mental energy in the moment finishing the task itself and to be less tempted in the moment the procastinate. 

#### 2.3 Don't multitask
The ability to disconnect allows you to get more things done that matter and prevent you from getting a chaotic brain: 
> People who multitask all the time can’t filter out irrelevancy. They can’t manage a working memory. They’re chronically distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand…they’re pretty much mental wrecks. — Clifford Nas

Not multitasking includes not sneaking in answering a text or emails:
> [...] it’s hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate. To put this more concretely: If every moment of potential boredom in your life—say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research. — Cal Newport

To reduce the chances of being distracted you can create an enviroment with less distractions, such as removing social media, turn-off notifications, use apps like Freedom to block content and use a headphone to block out sounds. 

#### 2.4 Use your unconscious to solve problems
Decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind is required (e.g. doing math). Decisions that involve large amounts of information and vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind might be better in solving it. 
> Observations from experiments such as this one led Dijksterhuis and his collaborators to introduce unconscious thought theory (UTT)—an attempt to understand the different roles conscious and unconscious deliberation play in decision making. At a high level, this theory proposes that for decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved. [...] On the other hand, for decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue. — Cal Newport

#### 2.5 Doodle & visualize
Companies like Facebook and Google use doodling to work more productively and creatively. Science suggest that eople who doodle recall more information, have a deeper understanding of a concept and are better able to communicate it to others. 
> According to Professor Jackie Andrade at the University of Plymouth, doodling is our mind’s way of ensuring that we have enough cognitive stimulation to stay focused and remain engaged in an information exchange. And that’s not all. In my work as an information designer and visual thinker, I’ve learned that doodling, sketching and drawing is our mind’s way of reflecting information back to itself, allowing us to grasp it more efficiently. Until we can see something, in many ways we can’t really know it at all. As the 20th-century French artist Henri Matisse said, “To draw is to make an idea precise. — Sunni Brown

#### 2.7 Rest
Resting serves three purposes:
- Provides you with an opportunity to recharge your energy.
- You can use this time to use the Internet and then avoid it outside these times. 
- To let your unconscious work on a decision. 

#### 2.8 Automate
Schedule time where you define and tackle things that can be automated. 

#### Stop being a perfectionist
This probably one of my biggest contrainst for when it comes to productivity. Although being a perfectionist can have it's advantages, it can also negatively impact your ability to get things done. 
> We found that perfectionism trips up professors on the way to research productivity. The more perfectionistic the professor, the less productive they are,” — Dr. Simon Sherry, psychology professor at Dalhousie University

Somes problems that can arise when you are a perfectionist:
- Spend more time than required on a task.
- Procrastinate and wait for the perfect moment.
- Neglecting the big picture while focusing too much on the small things.

# 3. Work disciplinary
Self-control is one of the most vital virtues for getting what you aim for; it's a better predictor of academic success than intelligence and a stronger determinant of effective leadership than charisma. Luckily, self-control works like a muscle. It gets tired from use, but regular exercise makes it stronger. Below are some principles that guide you using your self-control. 

#### 3.1 Separate real awards from false awards
If we recognize a reward -- i.e. a possibility to feel good, such as the sight of tasty food, the smell of coffee, noticing a notification -- dopamine is released. When dopamine hijacks your attention, the mind becomes fixated on obtaining or repeating whatever triggered it. It causes us to feel alert, awake and aroused, which can help you in achieving your goal. Nonetheless, it can make us feel restless and distracted too by steering us into immediate gratification. Thus, separate the real rewards that give our lives meaning from the false rewards that only provide you with immediate gratification. 
    
#### 3.2 Have self-compassion
When we fail to pursue the activities that we aim to pursue, there is a tendency to criticize yourself, which works counterproductive on our self-control:
> Study after study shows that self-criticism is consistently associated with less motivation and worse self-control. It is also one of the single biggest predictors of depression, which drains both “I will” power and “I want” power. In contrast, self-compassion—being supportive and kind to yourself, especially in the face of stress and failure—is associated with more motivation and better self-control. — Kelly McGonigal
    
#### 3.3 Respond consciously to the tricks your mind can play
Certain cognitive biases can causes brain to trick you in actions that doesn't help you in moving forward towards your goals. 
- **Moral licensing:** If you do something good, you feel good about yourself. This increases your trust your impulses—which can increase the tendency to give yourself permission to do something bad.
- **Goal dreaming:** A mind can get so excited about the opportunity to act on a goal, it mistakes that opportunity with the satisfaction of actually accomplished the goal, causing us to neglect actually working on the actual goal. 
- **Unrealistic optimism** The decision to change is the ultimate in instant gratification—you get all the good feelings before anything’s been done. But if you fail to meet expectations triggers the same old guilt, depression, and self-doubt, causing people to abandon their efforts altogether. Only after we feel out of control and in need of another hit of hope, we will once again vow to change.

# System
Now, after having discuessed the Principles, I will continue discusses the sytem, or processes I follow, I use. The system has processes on three different levels:
- Long-term goals (1+ year)
- Guiding goals (yearly - monthly - weekly)
- Daily goals (moment to moment tasks)

## Long-term goals
In Google Sheets I have a list of long-term goals which stay relateivley stable over time. These goals are often not concrete or precise,  but help me define which direction I want to go. 

## Guiding goals
I have the guiding goals seperated into three sheets in which I define my yearly, monthly and weekly goals. When I set the monthly goals, I keep in mind the yearly goals, and the weekly goals relate again to the monthly goals. 

After I have defined the monthly or weekly goals, I often create a project in a Task Manager (in my case Asana) to define the tasks that I have to complete to achieve a goal. This is done on a weekly basis, and I update the tasks that I have finished weekly in Asana. 

## Daily goals 
After having put the tasks into Asana that I want complete for that week, I at the end of every day take to the time to assign tasks to myself that I want to what I want to complete the next day. I also write down the lists of tasks in my  notebook, as I prefer having a physical checklist in sight, instead of shifting to Asana everytime I finish a task. I use my calendar to include apointments, and in some cases I would also define during what time periods I am working on what tasks.

## Reflections
Instead of updating the long-term, guiding and daily goals sporadicaly, I have schedulaed and priotized fixed time slots to reflect on them. During these slots I:
- **Track**: Track and update progress in the named tools above. 
- **Review**: Review how the period was, and if there was anything that I learned or could be improved. 
- **Clean-up**: Close programs tabs, save files in the right folder, clean-up email etc.
- **Plan**: Plan what I aim to do for the next period. 

## Tools to support my work
I have already named that I use Google Sheets, Asana and a calendar to define my planning. Additionaly, I use;
- **Notebook**: to make notes, doodle and visualize. 
- **Evernote:** to make and organize notes.

## Average (work) day
| Time  |      Activity      |
|----------|:-------------:|
| 09:00am-09:05pm| Review to-list and planning|
| 09:00am-12:00pm|  Work|
| 12:00pm-12:30pm |    Eat + Break    |
| 12:00pm-12:45pm|    Email + Messaging    |
| 3:00pm-3:15pm|    Break   |
| 3:15pm-4:45pm|    Work   |
| 4:45pm-5:00pm|    Clean + Review + Plan   |

Depending on how much I am in the flow, I often take 1 or 2 more timed breaks of approximately 15 minutes.
