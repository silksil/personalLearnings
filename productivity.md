## Mindset 

### Snow-ball effect: 
> A tree as big around as you can reach starts with a small seed; a thousand-mile journey starts with one step. — Lao-tse

When you have in mind to work on something, thoughts and internal obstacles can prevent you from actually making things happen. The longer you wait and the more you unconsciously think, the bigger the obstacle to actually start and make things happen. Thus, often the best way to make things happen is to **just start rolling**, and remember that there is no beginning and end, but only a **continuous cycle**. In the words of Benjamin Hoff: 

> Wisdom, Happiness, and Courage are not waiting somewhere out beyond sight at the end of a straight line; they’re part of a continuous cycle that begins right here. They’re not only the ending, but the beginning as well. The more it snows, the more it goes, the more it goes on snowing.

### Differentiate between "I want to" and "I have to"
As argued in the section above, internal obstacles can prevent you from actually making things happen. One way these internal obstacles can occur is by having the idea that tasks are an obligation, or having the feeling it is imposed on you. In other words, that you have the feeling that you have to do it, without having the feeling that you want to do it. Now, of course, it can happen that you have to do tasks that you do not enjoy doing. Nonetheless, these tasks become so much easier if you consciously decide that you want to do it anyway. In order to rationalize these decisions, I often say to myself that it's simply part of life, or that the tasks at least teach me to be disciplined. For example, I do not enjoy cooking that much, but **I want to eat healthy**, so **I want** to prioritize time buying groceries and cooking. 

## Habits
### Be clear on how you work
By reducing the need to make decisions about deep work moment by moment, I can preserve more mental energy for the deep thinking itself. 
* To make the most out of your deep work sessions, build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy as the important thinkers mentioned previously. 
    * Where you’ll will work and for how long.
    * How you’ll work once you start to work.
    * How you’ll support your work.
* […] don’t waste mental energy figuring out what you need in the moment

### Focus on what is important
### Be accountable 
### Measure
Act on Lead Measures […] Lag measures describe the think you’re ultimately trying to improve. […] Lead measus, on the other hand, “measures the new behaviour that will drive success on the lag measures.” 
### Remove distractions
### Embrace downtime and boredom
Once your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, Nass discovered, it’s hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate. To put this more concretely: If every moment of potential boredom in your life—say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research, it’s not ready for deep work—even if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration.

Downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply
The authors of this study, led by the Dutch psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis, set out to prove that some decisions are better left to your unconscious mind to untangle. 
* Don’t take breaks from distraction. Instead take breaks from focus. 
* Schedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times.
### Structure your deep thinking

### Elimenate roadblocks
When working it happens you encounter tasks that consume time, whereas this is unnecessary,  or at least the time spend on these tasks can be reduced. In order to tackle this, it's a wise investment to prioritize time defining and tackling these inefficiencies. Examples of inefficiencies that can be tackled:
* Making it easy to find information across different platforms (Drive, Evernote, Desktop, Email etc.)
* Have a password manager (Dashlane)
* A tool that automatically fils in forms with contact info (Dashlane)
* Automatically start all programs that are essential for being productive when starting the computer. 

In order to assure you don't forget inefficiencies that come-up and you notice while working, you can create a file where you can note the inefficiency. Periodically(in my case weekly)I have scheduled a time slot that focuses on actually tackling these issues.
