# Introduction
Investing time to improve your productivity can increase your output drastically over time. Not surprisingly, millions of productivity books are being sold yearly, and the internet is overloaded with so many articles on this topic that you wouldn't able to consume it over a lifetime even if you would make it a full-time job. 

I don’t have Ph.D. on productivity, but I have read information written by people who have studied the topic extensively,  and this article aims to bring all that knowledge together by outlining my personal key-learnings. 

This article is divided into two parts. The first part — which I have named _principles_ — describes the guiding principles I follow to be productive. These principles are very much universal and applicable to most individuals that work in jobs that require mostly mental energy (opposed to physical energy), and if you would pick up any book on productivity it’s likely that most of these principles are being discussed in there. The second part, which I refer to as _systems_, glues many of these principles together by describing how I apply them in the real world and what I do daily moment to moment. Whereas the section _principles_ focus more on the macro, universal, higher-level thoughts and ideas,  _system_ focusses more on the micro, personal and the moment by moment processes I follow. 

As with most information that is out there, 90% is copied from somebody else, and 10% is my own. Throughout the article, I will refer to the sources I have used, and in the end, you will find a list of all the resources. Lastly, I believe it is good to know that some of the most productive people [continuously make changes](https://www.fastcompany.com/3062639/why-the-most-productive-people-constantly-change-their-methods) in the way they work. So, it’s likely that I also will make changes over time, and I will make sure I will update this article every time something significant changes. 

# Principles
As said before, this part describes principles, or rules, that will guide you in being productive. To better understand what I think it takes to be productive, I have separated these principles into three sub-sections:
1. **Work effectively:** getting the right things done. 
2. **Work efficiently:**  getting more things done. 
3. **Work disciplinary:** getting more things done through self-control.

## 1. Work effectively
#### 1.1 Set goals
It's hard to navigate without having something to aim at—you need goals to guide yourself in the right direction. Goals refer to the results you want to achieve, not how you want to achieve it (see 2.1. 'Follow a system')

#### 1.2 Prioritize
You got limited time and resources, and different desires can lead to conflicting goals. So focus on the goals that are the wisest possible investment of your time and energy. 

# 2. Work efficiently
#### 2.1 Follow a system
Besides having defined the goals, you have to have processes that lead to those desired results. 
> Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. — James Clear

In the second part of this article, I will go more into the depth into the processes that I follow. Additionally, there are many methodologies that you can draw inspiration from: 
- Online Marketing: GROWS process. 
- Programming/project management: SCRUM
- Brainstorming: Design thinking
- Product/market fit: Lean Startup Canvas, The Value Proposition Canvas, SPRINT

#### 2.2 Break goals into manageable pieces
After having defined (big) goals, you need to break them down into manageable pieces. Pieces you can relate to the big goals, and where you know daily from moment to moment what to do in order to achieve those goals. Turning goals into small tasks that are manageable, prevents procrastination and help you avoid being overwhelmed. 

#### 2.3 Timebox
Instead of using to-do lists, you can “live in your calendar.” This means taking your to-do list, estimating how long each item takes, migrate it into a calendar and stick to it. A study on 100 productivity tips conducted by an ed-tech company, called filtered.com, found that timeboxing was ranked as the most useful. It works because it touches many aspects of behavior: 
> [..] single-tasking and focus to achieve more and feel less stressed, prioritising work to observe deadlines, frequent feelings of accomplishment, and being transparent so people can see what you’re doing and help. The tricky bit is chunking the tasks and estimating how long they’ll take, but this skill improves rapidly with practice. Key to this is time-boxing into a shared calendar and taking commutes, meetings, and other commitments into account. — The Definitive 100 Most Useful Productivity Tips, filtered.com

#### 2.4 Don't be a perfectionist
This probably one of my biggest constraints when it comes to being productive. Although being a perfectionist can have its advantages, it can also negatively impact your ability to get things done. 
> We found that perfectionism trips up professors on the way to research productivity. The more perfectionistic the professor, the less productive they are,” — Dr. Simon Sherry, psychology professor at Dalhousie University

Some problems that can arise when you are a perfectionist:
- Spend more time than required on a task.
- Procrastinate and wait for the perfect moment.
- Neglecting the big picture while focusing too much on the small things.

#### 2.5 Don't multitask
The ability to disconnect and focus on one thing allows you to get more things done and prevent you from getting a chaotic brain: 
> People who multitask all the time can’t filter out irrelevancy. They can’t manage a working memory. They’re chronically distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand…they’re pretty much mental wrecks. — Clifford Nas

#### 2.6  Avoid distractions and plan distraction time
Not multitasking includes not sneaking in answering a text or emails:
> [...] it’s hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate. To put this more concretely: If every moment of potential boredom in your life—say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research. — Cal Newport

To reduce the chances of being distracted you can create an environment with fewer distractions, such as removing social media, turn-off notifications, use apps like Freedom to block content and use a headphone to block out sounds. Additionally, you can schedule timeslots where you allow yourself to engage in activities that you normally sneak in between work, such as answering your email and answering texts. 

#### 2.7 Use your unconscious to solve problems
Decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind is required (e.g. doing math). Decisions that involve large amounts of information and vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind might be better in solving it. 
> Observations from experiments such as this one led Dijksterhuis and his collaborators to introduce unconscious thought theory (UTT)—an attempt to understand the different roles conscious and unconscious deliberation play in decision making. At a high level, this theory proposes that for decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved. [...] On the other hand, for decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue. — Cal Newport

#### 2.8 Doodle & visualize
Companies like Facebook and Google use doodling to work more productively and creatively. Science suggests that people who doodle recall more information, have a deeper understanding of a concept and are better able to communicate it to others. 
> According to Professor Jackie Andrade at the University of Plymouth, doodling is our mind’s way of ensuring that we have enough cognitive stimulation to stay focused and remain engaged in an information exchange. And that’s not all. In my work as an information designer and visual thinker, I’ve learned that doodling, sketching and drawing is our mind’s way of reflecting information back to itself, allowing us to grasp it more efficiently. Until we can see something, in many ways we can’t really know it at all. As the 20th-century French artist Henri Matisse said, “To draw is to make an idea precise. — Sunni Brown

#### 2.9 Rest and Move
Instead of checking your phone during a break, you can move your body by going for a walk or playing a game of ping-pong. Moving gets your blood flow going, provides you with an opportunity to recharge your energy and allows your unconscious to work on a problem. 

#### 2.10 Automate
Schedule time where you define and tackle things that can be automated. 

# 3. Work disciplinary
Self-control is one of the most vital virtues to achieve what you aim for; it's a better predictor of academic success than intelligence and a stronger determinant of effective leadership than charisma. Luckily, self-control works like a muscle. It gets tired from use, but regular exercise makes it stronger. Below are some principles that guide you using your self-control. 

#### 3.1 Separate real awards from false awards
If we recognize a reward (i.e. a possibility to feel good, such as the sight of tasty food, the smell of coffee, noticing a notification) dopamine is released. When dopamine hijacks your attention, the mind becomes fixated on obtaining or repeating whatever triggered it. It causes us to feel alert, awake and aroused, which can help you in achieving your goal. Nonetheless, it can make us feel restless and distracted too, causing humans to be steered into immediate gratification. Thus, separate the real rewards that give our lives meaning from the false rewards that only provide you with immediate gratification. 
    
#### 3.2 Have self-compassion
When we fail to pursue the activities that we aim to pursue, there is a tendency to criticize yourself, which works counterproductive on our self-control:
> Study after study shows that self-criticism is consistently associated with less motivation and worse self-control. It is also one of the single biggest predictors of depression, which drains both “I will” power and “I want” power. In contrast, self-compassion—being supportive and kind to yourself, especially in the face of stress and failure—is associated with more motivation and better self-control. — Kelly McGonigal
    
#### 3.3 Respond consciously to the tricks your mind can play
Certain cognitive biases can cause your brain to trick you into actions that don't help you in moving forward towards your goals. Being aware and responding to them consciously can prevent you from being tricked. A list of biases that can deplete your self-control:
- **Moral licensing:** If you do something good, you feel good about yourself. This increases your trust your impulses—which can increase the tendency to give yourself permission to do something bad.
- **Goal dreaming:** A mind can get so excited about the opportunity to act on a goal, it mistakes that opportunity with the satisfaction of actually accomplished the goal, causing us to neglect actually working on the actual goal. 
- **Unrealistic optimism** The decision to change is the ultimate in instant gratification—you get all the good feelings before anything’s been done. But if you fail to meet expectations triggers the same old guilt, depression, and self-doubt, causing people to abandon their efforts altogether. Only after we feel out of control and in need of another hit of hope, we will once again vow to change.

# System
This section continues by discussing the _system_, or processes,  I follow. In these processes, many of the principles are included that were being discussed in the previous section. My system can be separated into processes on three different levels:
- Long-term goals (1+ year)
- Guiding goals (yearly - monthly - weekly)
- Daily goals (moment to moment tasks)

For all three levels, I have fixed periodical time slots in my agenda (for the yearly goals once a year, monthly once a month etc.) during which I reflect and plan on goals. How these reflections look like depends on the type of goal(s) I have to reflect and plan on, but in general, it includes: 
- **Track**: Track and update progress in the named tools above. 
- **Review**: Review how the period was, and if there was anything that I learned or could be improved. 
- **Clean-up**: Close programs tabs, save files in the right folder, clean-up email etc.
- **Plan**: Plan what I aim to do for the next period. 

Additionally, it's good to know that  I employed as a developer and our team follows the SCRUM methodology. When I set and track long-term, yearly and monthly goals, it relates to personal goals (wealth, sport, fitness, career etc.). This includes goals that relate to my career (e.g. finish a course on technology X), but not so much to the projects I am engaged in through my employer, as in SCRUM methodology planning is a team effort and it is suggested to focus on short-term instead of long-term planning. Nonetheless, the goals and tasks in relation to my work do come into play when setting and tracking weekly and daily goals. 

## Long-term goals
In Google Sheets, I have a list of long-term goals. These goals stay relatively stable over time and I only update them sporadically, for example when I have an insight. These goals are often not concrete or precise,  but help me with defining more concrete _guiding goals_ (yearly, monthly, weekly). 

## Guiding goals
I have the guiding goals separated into three tabs in Google Sheets in which I define my yearly, monthly and weekly goals. When I set the monthly goals, I keep in mind the yearly goals, and when I set the weekly goals I relate them to the monthly goals. After I have defined my weekly goals, I divide the goals into manageable pieces and I include the pieces, or tasks, into a task/project managing tool (in my case Asana). 

## Daily goals 
After having put the tasks into Asana that I want complete for that week, I at the end of every day take to the time to assign tasks to myself that I want to what I want to complete the next working day. I also write down the lists of tasks in my notebook, as I prefer having a physical checklist insight, instead of shifting to Asana everytime I finish a task. I use my calendar to include appointments, and in some cases, I would also define during what time periods I am working on what tasks.

## Tools to support my work
I have already named that I use Google Sheets, Asana and the Apple Calendar to define my planning. Additionally, I use;
- **Notebook**: to make notes, doodle and visualize. 
- **Evernote:** to make and organize notes.

## Average (work) day
| Time  |      Activity      |
|----------|:-------------:|
| 09:00am-09:05pm| Review to-list and planning|
| 09:00am-12:00pm|  Work|
| 12:00pm-12:30pm |    Eat + Break    |
| 12:00pm-12:45pm|    Email + Messaging    |
| 3:00pm-3:15pm|    Break   |
| 3:15pm-4:45pm|    Work   |
| 4:45pm-5:00pm|    Clean + Review + Plan   |

Depending on how much I am in the flow, I often take 1 or 2 more timed breaks of approximately 5-15 minutes.
